Crawlsane
================

Crawlsane is a project aimed at crawling external resources, in particular Massive
Open Online Courses (MOOCs). There is however nothing preventing Crawlsane
to be extended and modified to be used elsewhere.

 It heavily takes use of Ryan McCue's brilliant Requests library.
