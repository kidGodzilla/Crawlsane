Crawlsane
================

Crawlsane is a project aimed at crawling external resources to retrieve general
meta-information and thumbnails.

This project is developed mainly with MOOC's and online courses in mind. There is
however nothing preventing Crawlsane to be extended and modified to be used elsewhere.
